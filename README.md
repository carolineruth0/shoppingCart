Title: Shopping Cart

Description: This project displays items to shop. The files in this project contain code provided by the Full Stack Development with MERN course with edits by me.

How to run: Download all files. Node.js is required. Use powershell and navigate to the folder with the downloads. Start a server in that folder and put its address in your browser.

Future improvements: I would like to add more items.
